# The-Mobile-Lab
The Mobile Lab is an iOS app that allows the user to create a drum sequence anywhere by emulating physical beat machine hardware. The user can create and edit beats by using the midi sequencer or by recording their input using the beat pads.  There are 8 separate tracks, each of which can play a different sound sample. Users can edit the volume of each of the tracks using the Mixer. Mixer tracks consists of a volume fader, mute and solo button. Solo will mute all of the other tracks except for the selected track. Each track is then bused into the master track, which controls the total volume.  Additional sounds can be found in the included sound database where users can audition sounds before setting it to the selected track.
